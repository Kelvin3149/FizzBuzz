# FizzBuzz

This Python code solves the FizzBuzz problem.

# Description

The program takes a starting number and an ending number, and iterates through each number in this range. For every number, it checks:

- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz"
- If the number is divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz"
- If the number is divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz"
- If neither is the case it prints the current number
